### Program Notes
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with the movement of pendulums. Even from a very simple object, you can use the equations that describes it to calculate how long it would take to fall through the earth. My favorite use of pendulums, however, is a demonstration that I first saw at a science museum when I was young. Several pendulums with different heights are set to start at the same angle. The pendulums will start in phase and quickly go out of phase, and then slowly slide back in phase after a while. I wanted to explore this idea with voices and acapella percussive effects as the vehicle which drives this piece forward.
