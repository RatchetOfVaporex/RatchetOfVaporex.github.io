        <p>The rise of technology in the past hundred years has seen an exponential growth and expansion of information and communication across previously-thought insurmountable barriers, like that of culture and distance. These barriers are now either in the process of being dismantled through the usage of online communication or have already been surmounted by other technologies. It is no wonder that many teachers and educators have taken to either using or producing educational videos in the classroom. In the fields of medicine, large institutions have created video series and uploaded them to YouTube for learning, teaching and training those entering the field of medicine, with a considerable amount of success (Rangarajan). These videos on Youtube are what would be considered to be “good” quality videos on YouTube, and are fit to serve the consumer well. But the majority of the videos on YouTube come from individual creators and not large corporations. In fact, the research shows that content posted on social media under the header of “Education” by individual entities had lead to a large spread of misinformation, and it is hard to control this spread because of the current struggles that the content identification systems on YouTube currently face. Despite this, there is a large amount of well-thought and researched content in the musical section of YouTube, who bear the hardships of the scrutiny of the system in order to provide content to their audiences.</p>

        <p>Chaos.</p>

<p>Maybe not complete and utter chaos, but that’s what we were rapidly approaching.
This was an awful situation to be handed, one that not even the great Loki himself could have envisioned throwing on upon us. We were in one of the worst predicaments that I have ever faced as a musician: My director was sitting right in front of me. We were all lost. There was absolutely no sense of leadership amongst the group.</p>

<p>And I wasn’t sure how we were going to get out of this.</p>
